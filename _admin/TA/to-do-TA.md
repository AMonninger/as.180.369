To Do List:
[ ] Look through the repo to delete any personal info from last year’s class
[ ] Check with JHU about whether we can get JHU to pay for subscriptions to PaperPile and LitMaps and perhaps other tools
[ ] For any classes for which there are Zoom recordings from last year but no “Meeting Summary” generated by the Zoom “AI companion”, see whether there is a way to retrospectively create the meeting summaries
[ ] Edit course syllabus to incorporate NASA Open Science Course
[ ] other to-do activities
